-Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room client is a game. It is currently only available on Android, and want to expand into a web-based application that is accessible on iOS, desktop, and multiple platforms. They wanted me to develope an application that is user friendly and accessible. It also must support a lot of users. The game must support muliple players, and also implement secure authentication and data privacy.They want a secure, and interactive game experience while ensuring smooth gameplay across different operating systems.

•	What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

What I did particularly well was developing a clear organization and structured documentation. I outlined business and technical requirements, ensuring all stakeholders understand the needs for expanding Draw It or Lose It to multiple platforms. I also talked about encryption and authentication, which are crucial for protecting user data. And I was also very detailed with what needed to be included in the design constraints. 

•	What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

What I found helpful was how important it is to make the document first before you code. It made development faster, more structured, and less error-prone. The design document clarified business and technical requirements as well. It also pointed out that security and privacy were a high concern. Knowing this before hand it crucial. 

•	If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I had to choose one part of my work to revise it would be the Evaluation section. To improve this section I would provide more details for the sever side. I would include benchmark data on server response times, memory usage, and processing speed to give a more data-driven recommendation.

•	How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I interpret the users needs by reviewing both the business and technical requirements outlined in the project. The client wanted scalability for example so to address this, I suggested cloud-based hosting solutions like AWS or Azure, which provide scalability and reliability. It is important to consider the users needs because it will ensure adoption and long-term success. It is important to prioritize the users experience because it encourages engagement and positive feedback. 

•	How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I approached design software by a thorough analysis of business and technical requirements, ensuring that the final design aligned with the client’s needs. I choose web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to ensure the game could run on Windows, Mac, Linux, and mobile devices. In the future to analyze and design software I would employ Agile development methodologies, such as Scrum, to ensure an iterative design process where requirements are continuously refined based on user feedback. I would also perform load testing to ensure the software can scale. And I would focus on the user experience.
